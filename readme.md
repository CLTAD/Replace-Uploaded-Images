## About

A Wordpress plugin designed to overcome the problem of users uploading very large images directly from digital cameras.
The uploaded image is deleted and replaced by the Wordpress-generated 'Large size' version.
The plugin is enabled by default on installation, but can be disabled in Settings -> Media -> Replace Uploaded Images
The size of 'Large size' images can be edited in Settings -> Media -> Image Sizes.

## Install

1. Copy the 'replace-uploaded-images' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress.


## Usage

The plugin is enabled by default but can be disabled at Settings -> Media -> Replace Uploaded Images
